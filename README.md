The RShiny app that this code creates is here: https://psrcwa.shinyapps.io/ctpp-explorer/

The RShiny app shows commute mode shares in Puget Sound Regional Council(PSRC)'s regional growth centers.

Regional growth centers are central to PSRC's regional growth strategy. See https://www.psrc.org/our-work/centers We will be updating the regional growth center monitoring data in the coming year. Previously, PSRC produced a long pdf (188 pages!) with dense data and text, https://www.psrc.org/sites/default/files/2022-03/centers_monitoring.pdf. In the update to the regional centers monitoring work, we hope to create a more accessible data product to elucidate the performance of regional growth centers vis-a-vis PSRC's goals. This app is a first step to modernizing how PSRC monitors regional growth center performance.

This app relies upon an R library that makes it easy to pull CTPP data from the api in PSRC geographies, and for commonly requested data items. See: https://github.com/psrc/psrcctpp
